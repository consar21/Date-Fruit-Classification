DateVisionary: Advancing Image Pre-processing for Precision Date Fruit Classification

The date fruit is a prime example of agricultural diversity, boasting over 200 types worldwide. As an essential component of human well-being, food classification plays a pivotal
role in safeguarding nutritional diversity, promoting food security, and fostering societal
resilience. However, sorting and classification tasks are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to inefficiencies in the market. This study focuses on leveraging image preprocessing techniques combined with deep learning models to enhance the accuracy of date
fruit classification. We utilized a dataset of 1,483 images representing eight distinct classes
of date fruits. The images underwent preprocessing, including cropping, resizing, segmentation, and morphological closing. Two prominent deep learning models, MobileNet and
ResNet, were employed for the classification task. The results demonstrated that image
preprocessing significantly improved the performance of both models. Notably, the MobileNet model outperformed the ResNet model, achieving an accuracy of 95.48% compared to ResNet's 83.04%. Additionally, both models exhibited strong performance regarding recall and precision, effectively learning complex patterns within the data. These findings have significant implications for the date fruit industry, indicating that these advanced
techniques can be employed to improve quality assessment and classification processes
